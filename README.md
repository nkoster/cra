"Create React App"

Create a React project boilerplate, "hot reload" included.

This thing exists because the "create-react-app" started to behave in a way I don't like.

Please check this [dev.to](https://dev.to/nikhilkumaran/don-t-use-create-react-app-how-you-can-set-up-your-own-reactjs-boilerplate-43l0) page.
Stuff described overthere is pretty much the basement of this simple bash script.

Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/nkoster/cra
cra/cra myProject
cd myProject
npm start
```
